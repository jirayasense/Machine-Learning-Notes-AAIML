DL Notes 1 Facts

-> DL works well for Image & Time-Series data

-> Today's state of the art is deep-learned features   
      (whether it may be Image Recog or Medicinal Application

=>=> `Haar` features are one of the advance Image Processing Features

=> Best way to learn Time Series Data is LSTM
=> Best way to learn the Image Data is CNN Deep Learning Algo

-> deep learning techniques are data hungry
