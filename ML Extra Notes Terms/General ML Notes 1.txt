General ML Notes

-> In ML model & featurization are inter-related

-> Domain Knowledge & Feature Engineering are equally imp in ML as framing a Model/Aglo

-> To make your model Robust 
     we can employ :- Generalization via Regularization
                      RANSAC
                      Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

-> Productionization Model :- High ThroughPut & Low-Latency Application

-> Temporal Nature of Data :- Change over time  // consider it using train-test-split

-> Cross Validations is more trustworthy than the domain knowledge
