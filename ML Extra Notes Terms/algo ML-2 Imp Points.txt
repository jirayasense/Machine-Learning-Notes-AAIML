algo ML-2 Imp Points

- Hyper-param & CV
 ------ 
Train - Test Split :
     \
      Grid-SearchCV for finding best split ratio or optimal hyper-parameter (via Cross Validation)

----
 KNN :- instance based method
 NB  :- Probabilistic method
 Log-Reg, Linear-Reg, SVM  :- Geometry Inspired

---

* Convex Hull for SVM : 

* SVM :- 
    RBF kernel imp   // intution similar to KNN

    Algo to implement Dual Form of SVM :- SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization)

* DT
  
  => Feature will only be imp or useful when it reduces the entropy going down level in DT
  or 
  => If IG due to that feature fi is maximum overall whilst constructing tree then that feature is 
     imp

* Gradient Descent :
  ------------
   -> To approximate the optimization of a variable via update steps
   - Eg Linear Regression

  Steepest Descent :
  ------
   -> Similar concept to GD, where functions are optimized instead of variable
   - Eg pseudo-residual
