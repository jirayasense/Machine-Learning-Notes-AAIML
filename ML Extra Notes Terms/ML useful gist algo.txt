-> Loss term
   Regularizer term

   Approximation Func for Loss-Term

   Optimization Problem
   Constrained Optimization Problem / Langrange Multiplier
   
   Sparsity & Density of Data

 -> Instead of term derivative we can use term gradient or grad

 -> Basic Way to approach & solve problem :

     1) Write the Objective Func
     2) Impose any constraints if required
     3) Finalise Optimization Problem
     4) Take first Derivative = 0 & solve the problem
        or
        Use technique such as GD or SGD
     5) Use Langrange muliplier if required

* Variance :=
    Model changes a lot with slight change in Training Data

  Model Err := bias^2 + variance

=> Business Problem vs ML problem

=> New feature to be included for Model Consideration should be Such That its get correlated with the 
   error (from model that was trained with that new feature inclusion)

=> When you have high dimension data, linear Models performs very well

=> Randomm Vectors are used in LSH in KNN
