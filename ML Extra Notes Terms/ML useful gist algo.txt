-> Loss term
   Regularizer term

   Approximation Func for Loss-Term

   Optimization Problem
   Constrained Optimization Problem / Langrange Multiplier
   
   Sparsity & Density of Data


 -> Instead of term derivative we can use term gradient or grad


 -> Basic Way to approach & solve problem :

     1) Write the Objective Func
     2) Impose any constraints if required
     3) Finalise Optimization Problem
     4) Take first Derivative = 0 & solve the problem
        or
        Use technique such as GD or SGD
     5) Use Langrange muliplier if required


* Variance :=
    Model changes a lot with slight change in Training Data

  Model Err := bias^2 + variance
