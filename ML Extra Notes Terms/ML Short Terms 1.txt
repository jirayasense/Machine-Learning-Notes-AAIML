ML Short Terms 1

Sparse Vectors
Sparse Matrix    // matrix with rows as sparse vectors

Sparsity of matrix // percent of non-useful cell

Heuristic | Hack

Norms & distance & length

Low-Latency System

Overfitting, Underfitting

Randomized Algorithm (not always give right ans but most probably give correct ans)

Probabilistic vs Determinitsic Outcome

Accuracy, Error | MissClassification

Disparity

Black-Box Model & Interpretable Model

Sparse :- not-uniform/random spread of data in the sparse dimension

Dumb Model | Sensible Model | Random Model
