-> Geometrically Interpretation means :
      \
       argmin() or argmax()
       &
       DotProduct & Distance Observation

     - involves the hyperparam :- C  (with Loss Func)


-> Loss-Minima Interpretation means :
     \
      Plot graph between 2 
          1) Error & Loss
          2) signn_dist & Probability

    - involves the hyperparam :- lma  (with Regularizer term)


-> Best Example of Probabilistic Interpretation is Gaussian Naive Bayes
