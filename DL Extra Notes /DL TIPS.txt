DL TIPS

=> while doing it keras & tensorflow way, you can use Violin Plots to see distribution of Weight among diff Hidden Layers

=> Data Augmentation is esp used for Image Dataset 
   \
    used mostly in CNN

=> Initial layers in CNN often deal with the task of detecting the Borders, Common Shapes & Likewise
   (which is common among all tasks esp when we talk about Images)

=> Keep Small Learning Rates when you FineTune Your Model
