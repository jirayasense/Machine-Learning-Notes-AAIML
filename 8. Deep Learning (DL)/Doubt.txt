Doubt

1) Auto Enncoder & Dimen Reduction

   -> At the end if we are having same dimension in output as input, then what is 
      dimensionality reduction done or achieved ??

   Is it that we need to Consider the Hidden layer for the above consideration ??
   -> IF yes then in case of MLP with multiple hidden layers, which one to pick as reduction layer consideration ??
