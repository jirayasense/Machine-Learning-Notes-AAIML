* Convolution :
---------------

=> Kernels are typically Square Matrix for most Image Processing

* Concepts :
  ---

1) Convolution : analogous to Dot product (for matrix)

2) Padding : to get more or same dimen in Output Matrix during Convolution

3) Striding :- to reduce dimen in Output Matrix during Convolution



* CNN :
  ----

  CNN is quite diff than ordinary MLP-NN
   |
   Wee've Convolution Layer &
          Max-Pooling layer

  -> For Optimizzation we need to ensure that this layers are differentiable


* ConvNet :
  ----
   -> Just like in MLP we denote reln between 2 layers nodes via Weight matrices
   -> In a ConvNet the relation between 1 pixel to another pixel is denoted by the Kernel Matrices
