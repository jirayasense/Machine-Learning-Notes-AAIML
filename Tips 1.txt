Tips 1

-> Always look at the plots (& Observe it & identify something)
   Always read the scale of a Plot

-> To plot any func -> just google -> `plot f(x)`   // replace whatever function with f(x)

-> To find lower & upper bound of interval in array (increasing order) :- use numpy.percentile()
     let say we want {p%} of interval

     lower bound = ((1 - p) / 2) * 100  percentile 
     upper bound = p   percentile


-> Norm of Xi vector square = Xi.transpose * Xi

-> Never make conclusion from Junk (Random data)

-> Use common sense to clean data

=> Given any problem if you can convert it to Vector then we can leverage power of Linear Algebra
