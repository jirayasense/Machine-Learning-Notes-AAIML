Math Notes 1

-> e is constant i.e called base of natural logarithm

-> Distributions are preferred over Percentile Models as they are more precise

=> Random Numbers are related with 2 topics Monte Carlo Approach & Uniform Distribution

=> Log is called a monotonnic function

* Monotonic Function :
  -------
   -> as x is incr f(x) also incr

* Sparse Matrix :
  -------
   -> Matrix where any row contains most of element of 0/useless
   -> i.e Matrix that has most of its rows as sparse vectors

* Sparse Vector :
  ------
   -> Vector that contains lots of elements as useless info/0

  Sparsity of Matrix :
    -> percent of non-useful cell (i.e zero cell) in a total cell

* distance vs Norm :
  -------------
   - distance between points & norm for a vector

* Polarity : (+ve/-ve)

* Hyper-plane is all abt defining its Normal (Vector)

* Density :- # points in unit area  | if more than more dense else less dense
