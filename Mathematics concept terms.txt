Mathematics concept terms

-> Feynman method of integration

-> Rectangular method
   Trapezoidal Method  (both to find AUC)

-> Equations :- Line, Circle

-> Monte Carlo Approaches (Random number)


----------------------


=> We've seen That Area of Shape We can utilise 2 methods :-
   
    - 1) AUC via Rectangular or Trapezoidal
      2) Monte Carlo method (via Randomization & Sampling)
      3) Approximation using Polygon
