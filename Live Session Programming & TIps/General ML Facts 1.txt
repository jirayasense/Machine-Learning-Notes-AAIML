=> Linear algebra is all about studying shapes ({Rectangle, Circle, Sphere, Cuboid, Line, Plane, etc...})

=> radians is most widely used than degree

Mathematcis Fact :
------
 -> Simplest way to represent the rectangle is by a Diagonal Coordinates 

 -> Root finding Problem (finding root of equation where f(x) = 0)

 -> Rate of Convergence -> How fast we're going towards x

  


Tips :-
----
 :- How to test optima, integral, derivative, ... functions you implemented manually ???
     -> For known function i.e( function output val known for input x) find & verify for such inputs.
