* Naive Bayes Gist

REMEMBER :-

-> Whenever You have Categorical feature, you can consider missing val as another feature (NAN)

=> Naive Bayes is much more memory efficient O(c * d) at run time (compare to KNN i.e (n * d))

-------------------------

-> It is based on Probability  
   (i.e Conditional Probability & Conditional Independence Probability)

-> Naive Bayes algo model is all abt feature importance i.e which feature participate more 
   in determining the labels

   Training Phase :- Likelihood & Priors

   Testing Phase :- Posterior  { ie likelihood lookups }

   Note : Excluding the Evidence as its common to all & constant (whilst comparision)

    - Likelihood :- participation of particular feature in class-label determination

-> Naive bayes is used for text-classification lie problems (benchmark algo fos such problems)

-> Laplace Smoothing 
   -----------
     - alpha & k terms
     - it is used to deal with unknown likelihoods lookup during test phase
   
   Log Probability :
   ---------------
   Log probabilities are used to avoid numerical underflow (ie floating point limitations in python)
   & provide compratively good numerical stability

-> Overfitting & Underfitting :
   ------------------

    alpha - small => overfitting
          - big   => underfitting

   alpha is hyper-param for Naive Bayes Model

-> For categorical features, -> missing val -> NAN
       numerical features    -> missing val -> Gaussian NB
