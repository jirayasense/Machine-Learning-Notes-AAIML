Pandas 

*-> 
   xlrd, a package use to read xls file (i.e excel file)
   openpyxl, a package to store data into excel file

-> DataFrame
   Series

   You can consider Series as numpy array-vector & do mostly all sorts of stuff on it likewise

   => Eg df.col_name == df.col_name.max()   // gives you the Mask i.e boolean array


=> row number is default indexing
   If you not provide index, then row number is itself index (i.e by default index)


* Indexing (Numerical)  <-** (Mimp)

=> iloc - by row number
   loc  - by index number

   loc[:3]   // slicing

* Custom Index :
  -----
   -> You can give custom `index` as parameter to pd.DataFrame([1,2,2], index=[0,1,2])

-----

* to_csv()
  ---
   -> also stores index as first column inside csv

* groupby()
  ----
   -> indices are not row number
   -> indices also shift in relative/according groups  (i.e indices remains intact)
        (row num starts with 1 for each new dataframe)

* pd.concat()

* pd.merge( , on="", type="")   // equi to join() in sql 


------
EXTRA

 df.sort_values()   //sort by column name
   .drop_duplicates()
