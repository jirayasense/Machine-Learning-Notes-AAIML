Doubts

1) Why to find minima we do double derivative ?? (Live Session Programming 1.3)


2) Why CDF can't be used directly when Distribution is not Gaussian

3) Q Actual Diff between Kernal Density Plot vs Normal PDF or CDF 
   (let say for Uniform Distb)


4) If two random variables are related in a deterministic way, how are the PDFs related?  
   (from prob stats interview que)
