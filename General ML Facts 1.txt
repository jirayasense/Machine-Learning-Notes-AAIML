=> Linear algebra is all about studying shapes ({Rectangle, Circle, Sphere, Cuboid, Line, Plane, etc...})

=> radians is most widely used than degree

ML = Art + Science
     Art = Feature Engineering/Trasnf, Exploration, EDA  (Creative)
     Science = geometry, probability, Algorithms

Mathematcis Fact :
------
 -> Simplest way to represent the rectangle is by a Diagonal Coordinates 

 -> Root finding Problem (finding root of equation where f(x) = 0)

 -> Rate of Convergence -> How fast we're going towards x

 -> Quantifying something (measuring how good or bad it is)

 -> Euc-dist gets affected by scale

 -> As Variance has slight upper edge of impact when compare to Bias As dimen incr, The Generalization 
    Error term have square for bias term

 -> Plane is represennted by Normal & Intercept

 => Every Model makes some assumptions

 -> Working Model is imp than Best Model

 -> To solve Real-World Problem more robustly, deal with Outliers very efficently


Algorithm :-
------
 -> So as far as ML is concern, We'll Consider Space Complexity at evaluation time as :
      total amount of space needed to evaluate at run time 

 -> To be sure about the algorithm to work on future data points, it must be tested on `Unseen data`

 -> If D_train & D_test have considerably diff distribution, then your model will fail on Test-Set
    (this can be possible when data changes over time)
    In such case CV-err = low & Test-Err = High

    So Distribution of your data plays pivotal role for your model to infer predictions in future

-> The whole Machine Learning is abt Underfit vs Overfit 
   The diff between best model & worst model is just about Underfit & OverFit

-> We are using Loss Func as Approximation to Optimization problem as
   Often times The Optimization Func is not differentiable & thus nonn-continuous

-> The Deep Learninng is tryimg to automate some part of Feature Engineering

-> The whole of ML is glorified Feature Engineering (with sime simple Algo)

=> One of the most imp algorithm for Optimization in ML is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
