=> Linear algebra is all about studying shapes ({Rectangle, Circle, Sphere, Cuboid, Line, Plane, etc...})

=> radians is most widely used than degree

Mathematcis Fact :
------
 -> Simplest way to represent the rectangle is by a Diagonal Coordinates 

 -> Root finding Problem (finding root of equation where f(x) = 0)

 -> Rate of Convergence -> How fast we're going towards x

 -> Quantifying something (measuring how good or bad it is)

 -> Euc-dist gets affected by scale

 -> As Variance has slight upper edge of impact when compare to Bias As dimen incr, The Generalization 
    Error term have square for bias term


Algorithm :-
------
 -> So as far as ML is concern, We'll Consider Space Complexity at evaluation time as :
      total amount of space needed to evaluate at run time 

 -> To be sure about the algorithm to work on future data points, it must be tested on `Unseen data`

 -> If D_train & D_test have considerably diff distribution, then your model will fail on Test-Set
    (this can be possible when data changes over time)
    In such case CV-err = low & Test-Err = High

    So Distribution of your data plays pivotal role for your model to infer predictions in future
